When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to share my work publicly to others seeking for suggestions for improvements or a bug that I cannot figure out by myself.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the changes sometimes might not be the ones that I want in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones allowed by Github for user to clone other's repository on Github. Clones is copying a repository to one's own  local repository whether from Github or other local repository. Branches are only exsited on a single repository with histories of commits from each branch. Forks are used when I need to create a repository on my own GitHub from one repository of others on GitHub which I can find a collaborator with. Clones are used when I only want to play with the code myself. Branches are used when I want to test different ideas on one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	We can know the changes whether made on remote repository or local repository using git log.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Well I guess maybe I'll just send a copy of the code to the person I want, then tell him/her the exact lines that have been added, and ask for feedback/modification. The time might be a little faster but it would be harder to track and record these changes if project becomes larger and more people invovled.
